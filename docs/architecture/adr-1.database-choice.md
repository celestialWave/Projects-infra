# Architecture Decision Record: Database Technology

## Context

We are building a new application that will need to store large amounts of data in a flexible schema. The data is likely to be highly nested and have varying structure across different entities. High availability, horizontal scalability, and the ability to distribute data across multiple servers are also key requirements.

## Decision

We have decided to use MongoDB as the database technology for this application. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document database that provides the schema flexibility, scalability, and distributed nature we require.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

### Advantages

* Schema Flexibility: MongoDB's document data model allows for highly flexible and nested data structures, making it well-suited for our varying data requirements.
* Horizontal Scaling: MongoDB is designed to scale out easily by distributing data across multiple servers through sharding.
* High Availability: MongoDB supports replica sets, which provide automatic failover and data redundancy.
* Rich Query Language: MongoDB's query language is powerful and allows for complex queries on nested data.
* Large Community & Adoption: MongoDB has a large and active community, ensuring ongoing development and support.

### Disadvantages

* No Transactions Across Multiple Documents: MongoDB only supports atomic transactions for operations within a single document. For multi-document transactions, we will need to implement our own application-level transaction management.
* Data Normalization Challenges: MongoDB's denormalized data model can lead to data duplication and potential consistency issues if not managed properly.
* Lack of Join Operations: MongoDB does not support join operations across multiple collections, requiring data denormalization or application-level joins.
* Operational Complexity: Managing a distributed MongoDB deployment, including sharding and replica sets, can introduce operational complexity.
