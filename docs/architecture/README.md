# Architecture Decision Records

An Architectural Decision Record is a document that captures an important architectural decision made in a software project, along with the context, reasoning, and consequences of that decision. ADRs are a way to document and communicate the rationale behind significant architectural choices, and they serve several purposes:

* Knowledge Sharing: ADRs help share the architectural knowledge and reasoning with the entire team, including future team members who may join later.
* Accountability: ADRs make the decision process transparent and create accountability for the decisions made.
* Historical Record: ADRs provide a historical record of the architectural decisions made throughout the project, which can be valuable for future reference or when revisiting past decisions.
* Context for Future Decisions: By documenting the context and trade-offs considered, ADRs provide valuable context for future architectural decisions that may be related or impacted.
* Onboarding: ADRs can help onboard new team members by giving them insight into the key architectural decisions and the reasoning behind them.

* ADRs typically include sections such as:

    1. Title and Status (e.g., Accepted, Proposed, Rejected)
    2. Context: The background and problem statement motivating the decision
    3. Decision: The decision that was made
    4. Consequences: The advantages, disadvantages, and other implications of the decision
